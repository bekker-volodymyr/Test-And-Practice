<h2>Zenject</h2>
 <p>
  To learn how to work with the Zenject framework, I created a specific folder and scene. For my first exploration of the framework, I followed a YouTube tutorial (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqEhy8nS3fk">link</a>). 
 </p>
 <p>
  As an example, I decided to create a logger interface with a Log(string message) method and two concrete loggers: DebugLogger, which writes data to the Debug console, and TMPLogger, which writes data to a TextMeshPro object with a specific tag.
 </p>
 <p>
  The logger dependency is injected into a Messenger class, which logs a simple message in the Start method. I plan to extend this Zenject implementation as I dive deeper into the framework.f

<h2> Cinemachine camera switch scene </h2>
 <p>
  This scene I use for experiment with cinemachine system and switching virtual cameras before adding it to my university project.
